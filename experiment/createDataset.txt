Before an experiment starts we need to extract lgen and assoc files using plink software. After assoc file extraction, we create a new assoc file based on p-value, in our experiment, we keep SNPs with p-value equal or less to 10^-4. We choose this p-value because all GWAS studies use p-value equal or higher to 10^-5*****.  Next, we create a matrix MxN, M is the number of patients and N is the Number of SNPs from assoc file. We code, each SNP for each patient, by value 0, 1 or 2. In order to give value to each SNP, we use lgen and assoc files. We check the two alleles of patients from lgen file and compare them with allele1 of assoc file. We give the value 2 when both of lgen' s file alleles is the same as assoc' s file allele1, value when one of them is the same and value 0 when neither of them is the same. After we finish with matrix' s creation, we use classifiers to predict the patient' s phenotype. We use either all SNPs or a subset of them using correlation feature reducing technique.
