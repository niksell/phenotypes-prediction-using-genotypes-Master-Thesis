In the below experiments, we study the ability classifiers have to predict if someone in the future will become a patient of an illness. We use some metrics such as recall, precision, AUC, recall, and f score to evaluate classifier's ability to predict. We also, try to extract SNPs, using features reducing techniques, they are important about the illness.  The data we have is the phenotypes and genotypes of patients.
