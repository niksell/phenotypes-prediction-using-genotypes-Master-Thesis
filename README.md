Cancer Melanoma is a type of cancer that develops in the skin and rarely occurs in the mouth. Different genetic variations and environmental reasons are responsible for its appearance. The goal of this thesis is to study whether it is possible to predict if someone will develop cancer melanoma (phenotype), by machine learning algorithms using the genotype information of the individual, in the form of SNPs. We constructed a pipeline that collects and processes the data, to produce the features and performs feature selection by identifying unique SNPs. We considered a variety of classification algorithms for the prediction task, and we studied the effect of the different parameters. To scale our approach to big data, we also implemented our pipeline in Apache Spark. We studied manually the extracted SNPâ€™s, and we compared the validity of our results with existing studies. We hope this to be a first step towards the use of machine learning for detecting cancer melanoma at its earliest stages.
